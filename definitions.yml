#This is an example robotics file I'm using. Coding my own language is not going to be easy as I've never done this before
#and I'm really just doing it to have a play around with my mind!

#define is used to define various other definitions required in the programming language. For example "define roboArm" means
#"roboArm" can be used in a syntax. For example "roboArm rotate left 20°"

#To define a range of parameters to be used with the definition simply enclose in brackets. For example "roboFoot(1-10)" could be
#used in "roboLFoot(6) tilt up 20°" to tilt the 6th toe on the left foot up 20°

#This is an example file for a fairly basic humanoid. Arms, legs, body, head + feet.

#When defining advanced parameters (for example the parts of a finger) instead of defining a whole new class for them, simply
add a comma after the first class and add the number of segments. For example, a hand has 5 fingers, those 5 fingers can be 
bent into three parts.
